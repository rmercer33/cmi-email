          <h2><em>A Course Of Love Second Edition</em> is now available in the library.</h2>
          <p>Dear %recipient_fname%,</p>
          <p>
            I am very happy to announce the addition of <em>A Course Of Love</em> to the Library of Christ Mind Teachings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>A Course Of Love</em> is a complete course on Self-knowledge leading to lasting benefits to your life. Itâ€™s
            not a book of mental concepts, but one that reaches into your heart and works a transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            ACOL posits that all changes we would like to see happening in our lives, even in the world, stem from a single
            change: moving from seeing ourselves as separate individuals, to seeing the truth that we are an integral part
            of life, and of an eternal Consciousness that exists in Unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have found ACOL to be an intimate, inspiring and eye opening guide to deeper experience of Christ consciousness.
            Along with <em>A Course in Miracles</em> and <em>The Way of Mastery</em> it is lovingly offered to support us on
            our journey of awakening to the Truth that is true always.
          </p>
          <p>
          Like all the content in the library <em>A Course Of Love</em> is fully searchable and shareable to Facebook and via
          email.
          </p>
          <p>
          You are cordially invited to discover <em>A Course Of Love</em> at
